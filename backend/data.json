    "content": "The margherita (€6.50) is always the first test of any good pizza place, and Mani's comes with homemade tomato sauce, Toonsbridge Fior di Latte, stracciatella, basil and EVOO. Whether you've had Roman style pizza before or not, the base here with its 80% hydration and three-day fermentation before baking will knock you sideways - so light while losing nothing in texture, so crisp without being dry or hard. Sweatshop levels of exertion have gone into this dough preparation and cook, and you can taste it as soon as it hits your mouth. Toppings were perfectly judged, with bright tomato under an oozing double cheese combo.",

    "content": "It's time again for a little-noticed vegetable: chicory. With its slightly bitter taste, it attracts fewer fans than the usually sweet pepper, but it is precisely this bitterness that makes chicory so interesting, and it is also extremely healthy, namely for the stomach and intestines. I like to sauté it in olive oil with a touch of butter and just salt - delicious! By the way, a variant that my sister made me tasty.",
